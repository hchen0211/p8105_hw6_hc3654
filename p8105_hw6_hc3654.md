\### Comment:

The plot reveals that the adjusted Odds Ratio (OR) is less than 1 for
the majority of cities, indicating a prevailing pattern where female
victims’ homicides have a higher solved advantage (odds) than those of
male victims.

However, a crucial finding is that the confidence interval for the OR
includes 1 for most cities. This means we lack sufficient statistical
evidence to claim a significant gender difference in clearance rates in
the majority of locations.

The results highlight two extremes: New York, NY, exhibits the strongest
disparity (OR lowest), where the difference in solved odds between male
and female victims is most pronounced and statistically significant.
Conversely, Albuquerque, NM, holds the highest OR, suggesting male
victims’ cases are either equally or more likely to be solved there.

The clustering of most OR estimates between 0.5 and 1.0 confirms that
while a bias exists, the magnitude of the disadvantage for male victims
is generally moderate to significant across the cities, driving the
overall conclusion that female victims’ homicides are generally more
likely to be solved across the dataset.
